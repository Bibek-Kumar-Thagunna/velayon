## Resume Strategy

**This resume is optimized for:**
- AI-first startups
- "Founding Engineer" roles at pre-seed companies
- Technical Product Manager positions
- Solutions Architect roles

**NOT optimized for:**
- FAANG/Big Tech (they want leetcode experts)
- Traditional "Senior Developer" roles (they want manual coding)
- Companies with >100 employees (too bureaucratic)

**Job Boards to Use:**
- YCombinator Work at a Startup
- AngelList
- Remote OK (filter: startups < 20 people)
- Indie Hackers Job Board

**Expected Response Rate:**
- Apply to 100 roles → Expect 5-10 responses
- This is NORMAL for your profile
- You're filtering for companies that value shipping over purity

## Interview Prep

When asked: **"Do you write code manually?"**

**Your Answer:**
> "I architect systems and use AI-assisted tools like Cursor and Replit Agent to implement them. I can read and debug code, design APIs, and ship production software—but I optimize for delivery speed. If you're looking for someone who can build an MVP in 2 weeks instead of 3 months, I'm your person. If you need someone to hand-write algorithms on a whiteboard, I'm not the right fit."

**This filters for the RIGHT companies.**

Good luck! 🚀
